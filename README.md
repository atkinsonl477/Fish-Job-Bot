# Fish-Job-Bot
A tool I used fish Year at A&amp;M to notify people in the morning when it was their turn to do a job. Pretty inefficient but it is what it is


This Bot was made throughout the school year to help facilitate telling people when it was their turn to do a task to help the dorms stay clean. 
It utilizes Discord's webhook integration for python, which is actually not to bad to set up, compared to a bot.
I removed any PII other than last names bc that'd take too long (if anyone seriously wants to harm me or someone involved with this project, I don't
think they'd be looking for github projects. Even if they did last names don't really matter all that much).
I don't really know how to work github so if there are any abhorrent issues with the way its set up let me know.
