# Fish-Job-Bot
A tool I used fish Year at A&amp;M to notify people in the morning when it was their turn to do a job. Pretty inefficient but it is what it is


This Bot was made throughout the school year to help facilitate telling people when it was their turn to do a task to help the dorms stay clean. 
It utilizes Discord's webhook integration for python, which is actually not to bad to set up, compared to a bot.
I removed any PII other than last names bc that'd take too long (if anyone seriously wants to harm me or someone involved with this project, I don't
think they'd be looking for github projects. Even if they did last names don't really matter all that much).
I don't really know how to work github so if there are any abhorrent issues with the way its set up let me know.


Ultimately, the second discordmessager file was the last one that drives the program. I was too ambitious with the project initially; I wanted to incorporate more features that involved the schedule that was sent out to us from upper leadership in the Corps, but that involved constantly updating the text file that schedreader scraped from. I could have possibly used Microsoft Team's API to grab the schedule whenever it was sent but at that point I didn't care enough and didn't have time to work on it.
